# DESIGN-PATTERNS-Singleton
Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
This project explain the Singleton design pattern in Java, specifically using it to manage a database connection. 
The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of the database connection is created and used throughout the application.
Having only one object from the data piece has many benefits, the first of which are:
## Resource Management:
In terms of efficiency, using a previously prepared connection is better than setting up a new one, and using only one object is better to reduce memory use.
## Consistency:
We can reduce errors that may occur due to simultaneous modifications.
